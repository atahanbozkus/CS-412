Methodology
1) Data Preparation and Preprocessing
Parsing HTML Files: The data set consists of HTML files. Unnecessary data is eliminated, and useful data is selected to make the data set more manageable and suitable for analysis.

Data Cleansing: Ensures the quality of data and its suitability for analysis. Noisy and incomplete data are corrected, with formatting and standardization processes applied.

Incomplete Data Processing: Handling of missing data is critical to maintain the integrity of the analysis and improve code performance. Missing data are carefully managed to avoid biases and enhance model accuracy.
